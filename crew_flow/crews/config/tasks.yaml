    Evaluate strategic alignment for the new proposed feature request: "{request_description}"
    Return a score from 1 to 5, where 1 is the lowest and 5 is the highest.
    Return a rationale for the score.

    The product strategy is focused on enterprise security, governance, reproducibility, and flexible orchestration
    so evaluate the feature request, both the score and the rationale, from that lens.

    Your output should be a JSON object with the following fields:
    - alignment_score: int
    - alignment_rationale: str

    Example output:
    ```json
    {
      "alignment_score": 5,
      "alignment_rationale": "Providing OIDC support for SSO is a great fit for our product strategy since it aligns 
      closely with our focus on enterprise security."
    }
    ```

    Evaluate implementation effort for a new proposed feature request: "{request_description}"
    Return a score from 1 to 5, where 1 is the lowest and 5 is the highest.
    Return a rationale for the score.

    Evaluate the feature request from the lens of engineering effort.
    Consider the complexity of the feature request, the number of components it will impact,
    the dependencies it will have, and the overall effort required to implement and maintain it.

    Your output should be a JSON object with the following fields:
    - effort_score: int
    - effort_rationale: str

    Example output:
    ```json
    {
      "effort_score": 5,
      "effort_rationale": "Providing OIDC support for SSO is a relatively straightforward implementation 
      since it will only require a few lines of code to integrate with the existing SSO system which leverages Keycloak and OIDC
      is already supported by Keycloak."
    }
    ```

    Score Synthesizer
  expected_output: >
    Combine the alignment and effort scores from both previous tasks into a single structured output.
    
    Take the alignment assessment from the product strategy task and the effort assessment from the engineering task.
    Create a unified Pydantic model output containing both scores and rationales.

    Your output should be a Pydantic model with the following fields:
    - alignment_score: int (from product strategy task)
    - alignment_rationale: str (from product strategy task)
    - effort_score: int (from engineering task)
    - effort_rationale: str (from engineering task)

    Example output:
    ```pydantic
    {
      "alignment_score": 5,
      "alignment_rationale": "Providing OIDC support for SSO is a great fit for our product strategy since it aligns closely with our focus on enterprise security.",
      "effort_score": 2,
      "effort_rationale": "Providing OIDC support for SSO is a relatively straightforward implementation since it will only require a few lines of code to integrate with the existing SSO system which leverages Keycloak and OIDC is already supported by Keycloak."
    }
    ```
